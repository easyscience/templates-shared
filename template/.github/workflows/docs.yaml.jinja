# This workflow builds and deploys documentation for the project.
#
# Overview:
#  - Converts tutorial Python scripts to Jupyter notebooks and executes them.
#  - Builds the documentation site using MkDocs with the Material theme.
#  - Uploads the built site as an artifact for local inspection.
#  - Deploys versioned documentation to the gh-pages branch using Mike:
#    - For release tags (v*): deploys to a versioned folder (e.g., /0.9.1/) and updates /latest/.
#    - For branches: deploys to /dev/.
#
# The action summary page will contain a link to the built artifact for downloading
# and inspecting, as well as a link to the deployed documentation site.
